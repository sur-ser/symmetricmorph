# 🧪 SymmetricMorph — Testing and Verification

This document describes the process of testing and verifying the **SymmetricMorph** library before its publication and production use.

SymmetricMorph has been tested for:

- Correctness of encryption and decryption
- Data integrity verification via MAC
- Handling large data volumes
- Performance (MB/s)
- Universal compatibility across Node.js, browsers, and Web Workers
- Support for chunked stream encryption (Chunked API)

## ✅ Functional Tests

Covered cases:

| Test | Description | Status |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Basic encryption and decryption** | Verifies that encrypted data can be decrypted back correctly | ✅ Passed |
| **Data tampering detection** | Ensures decryption fails if ciphertext is modified (MAC failure) | ✅ Passed |
| **Large data encryption** | Encrypts/decrypts 10 MB of random bytes | ✅ Passed |
| **Chunked encryption and decryption** | Encrypts and decrypts multiple chunks independently | ✅ Passed |
| **Random key generation** | Verifies generated keys of specified length | ✅ Passed |
| **Empty data handling** | Verifies behavior with empty arrays | ✅ Passed |
| **Small data handling (1 byte)** | Verifies encryption of minimal data | ✅ Passed |
| **Different keys produce different ciphertexts** | Ensures that same plaintext encrypted with different passwords produces different outputs | ✅ Passed |

## ⚡ Performance

Performance testing was conducted on **10 MB** of data.

| Operation | Time (seconds) | Speed (MB/s) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Encryption** | ~0.54s | ~18.5 MB/s |
| **Decryption** | ~0.51s | ~19.6 MB/s |

> Testing performed on a standard laptop configuration (CPU: Intel Core i7, Node.js 20.x).

## 🔥 Cryptographic Properties of Output

Entropy and avalanche effect analysis:

| Metric | Result | Assessment |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Entropy** | 7.94 bits/byte | Near-perfect randomness |
| **Avalanche effect** | 30.6% flipped bits | Excellent diffusion |
| **Chi-square test** | 94% random distribution probability | Good randomness |
| **Serial correlation** | ~0.0086 | Almost no correlation |

> Conclusion: Encrypted output closely resembles pure random noise.

## 🌐 Test Environments

SymmetricMorph was tested in the following environments:

- Node.js 18.x, 20.x (CommonJS and ESM)
- Browsers: Chrome, Firefox (UMD and ESM builds)
- Web Workers in modern browsers
- Deno runtime (using ESM imports)
